At NutmegLabs, our mission is to make local experiences better for everyone.

We provide an all\-in\-one “Customer Engagement Platform”, that supports a wonderful customer experience for guests from the time of booking through participation. Our platform digitizes the operator’s business with all\-inclusive features that cover digital marketing, sales, operations, and customer relations.

NutmegLabs was founded in 2018 in San Francisco. We rapidly expanded our B2B SaaS business globally despite major disruptions in tourism caused by the COVID\-19 pandemic.

We have existing clients in Hawaii who have seen great success in getting more online direct bookings and achieving dramatically streamlined operations. We are pursuing quick expansion in Hawaii to spread these benefits to more operators.

**Why NutmegLabs:**

Nutmeg resolves “Core Business Problems” for operators using digital solutions which focus on a comfortable guest experience as well as benefits to operators. We go for “Win\-Win\-Win” (Operators, Guests, Us) to achieve greater satisfaction for everyone.

Since most operators in tours \& activities still rely heavily on distributors (OTAs, Agents and Concierge), commissions paid to distributors erode business profits. We bring more direct online bookings to operators to cut down on commissions and support sustainable business growth. As a result, operators can focus on service quality and better guest satisfaction without complications added by distributors. This in turn increases freedom for operators when deciding directions for business growth.

You will win deep trust from operators, and provide better service for guests together with benefits to operators.Supporting operators of tour \& activities in Hawaii make their business succeeded with providing DX solutions by your work
