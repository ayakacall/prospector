The Manager, Technical Upskilling \& Enablement is accountable for the design, delivery, and outcomes of all technical upskilling across the Technology \& Experience (TechEx) practice. This role owns TechEx’s technical capability development end\-to\-end—defining learning expectations, delivering instruction wappropriate, and orchestrating scalable upskilling solutions through internal expertise, strategic partners, and curated learning assets.



As TechEx continues to grow, technical upskilling must scale without relying on practice\-led design or instruction, which competes with client delivery. This role centralizes ownership of technical upskilling, partners closely with the TechEx COO, and ensures practitioners develop durable, market\-relevant technical capability aligned to how TechEx delivers work in the market.



AI upskilling strategy is owned separately; however, this role collaborates with the AI organization on overlapping technical skills, delivery approaches, and learning experiences.


**Key Responsibilities**


**Technology \& Experience Technical Upskilling Ownership**


* Own all technical upskilling across TechEx, including:
* Data \& Analytics
* Platforms \& Customer Strategy
* Software
* Cybersecurity \& Enterprise Technology
* Define practice\-wide technical learning expectations, pathways, and requirements for key technical areas, technologies, and partnerships
* Be accountable for technical upskilling outcomes, not just learning activity
* Assess current\-state technical capabilities and identify skill gaps
* Evaluate existing learning solutions and evolve them as needed to improve scalability, consistency, and effectiveness


**Instructional Design \& Delivery**


* Design and deliver both synchronous and asynchronous technical instruction
* Establish standards for technical instruction quality and learning experience design
* Determine the appropriate upskilling approach based on the skill need:
* Buy / Build / Partner for strategic platforms and partnerships (e.g., Databricks, Salesforce)
* Buy / Build / Curate for broader or emerging technical skills

Personally teach complex, high\-impact, or niche technical topics w* hands\-on instruction is most effective and is within your area of expertise
* Evaluate and leverage third\-party instructors, vendors, and content libraries as needed
* Own the end\-to\-end upskilling solution regardless of delivery method


**Strategic Partnerships \& Certification Alignment**


* Partner with strategic partnership owners to ensure technical upskilling supports certification requirements and partnership commitments
* Enable TechEx practitioners to achieve and maintain certifications tied to market offerings
* Ensure technical capability remains aligned with evolving partner standards and technologies


**Leadership Partnership \& Governance**


* Partner extremely closely with the TechEx Leadership Team on technical upskilling strategy, priorities, and execution
* Present learning expectations, pathways, and requirements for approval by TechEx leadership

Collaborate with the AI organization on shared technical enablement w* overlap exists


**Required Qualifications**


* Strong technical background in one or more TechEx domains (e.g., Data \& Analytics, Software, Platforms (Salesforce, ServiceNow), Cybersecurity, Cloud, or related technical fields)
* Demonstrated experience designing and delivering complex technical instruction for technical audiences
* Experience owning or leading technical upskilling, enablement, or capability development initiatives
* Experience working with third\-party training providers, strategic partners, or external instructors
* Strong stakeholder management skills, including comfort partnering closely with senior leaders
* Excellent communication skills, with the ability to influence without direct authority


**Preferred Qualifications**


* Experience supporting technical upskilling at scale (hundreds of practitioners or more)
* Experience designing applied learning experiences such as labs, simulations, or real\-world use cases tied to delivery work
* Familiarity with strategic technology partnerships and certification\-based enablement models (e.g., cloud platforms, data platforms, enterprise systems)
* Experience assessing technical skill gaps and measuring capability development outcomes

Background in consulting, professional services, or delivery\-driven environments w* learning must coexist with client work
* Experience collaborating across adjacent organizations (e.g., AI, product, engineering, or platform teams)
